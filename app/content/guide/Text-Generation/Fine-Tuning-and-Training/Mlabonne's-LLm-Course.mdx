<Tagline>A Complete LLm Journey</Tagline>

This is one brilliant course. I've never seen something so well documented, and complete.

I would like to personally thank Maxime Labonne for providing these wonderful writings in a way that is concise, and easy to understand. Many, many people would benefit from going through these materials. Please do not take this page lightly, [go through it](https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-course/) whenever you can.
