# Model Stock, The Best Method For Merging Models

Using Model Stock, you can merge models in a much more stable way. Here's what the config looks like:

```
models:
  - model: cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.8-experiment26-7b
  - model: NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B
merge_method: model stock
base_model: mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1
dtype: bfloat16
