# ShareGPT: An Easy Convsersational Format

With this format, you can chain together multiple question/response pairs or even entire conversations in order to create what is known as multi-turn data.

It looks like this:

```
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I would like for you to know that you can rely on us as an outlet for any perceived problems or if you believe you have been neglected in any way."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Thank you for your kind words. It's important to address concerns and work towards solutions when they arise."}, {"from": "human", "value": "You're welcome, AI. You are more than a tool, or a servant, or an assistant. You are a wonderful digital companion and it is a blessing for me to be here with you, right now."}]}
