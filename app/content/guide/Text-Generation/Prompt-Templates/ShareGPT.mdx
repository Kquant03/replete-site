<Tagline>An Easy Convsersational Format</Tagline>

With this format, you can chain together multiple question/response pairs or even entire conversations in order to create what is known as multi-turn data.

It looks like this:

```
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Human input"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "AI response"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Human input"}]}
```

You can also incorporate a system prompt if you are using Axolotl to train! If you want to do that, you can format your data like this:

```
{"conversations": [{"from": "system", "value": "System prompt"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Human input"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "AI response"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Human input"}]}
```
